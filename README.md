# Note （Tensorflow, turtlebot, Gazebo）

## Pre-requisite
- Install [ROS-Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu), recommand Desktop-Full install.
- **(Optional, skip this step if you install ROS in Desktop-Full mode)** Install [Gazebo-7.0](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&ver=7.0)
- **(Optional)** Install [openai_ros](https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/openai_ros.git) 

## Setup Turtlebot Gazebo Simulation Environment
- Assume you have set up an ros workspace at `/home/yourname/ros_ws`, and ready to config the environment in it. 
`$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-turtlebot-gazebo`
Sometimes, you may need to `$ cd /opt/ros/kinetic`, then `$ source setup.bash`
- To make sure `turtlebot_gazebo` is launchable, try `$ roslaunch turtlbot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch`
- To get ready for reinforcement learning, `$ cd ~/ros_ws/src`, then clone this repo `$ git clone https://github.com/linZHank/turtlebot_rl.git`

## Start Q Learning
1. Launch learning environment, `$ roslaunch turtlebot_rl turtlebot_crib.launch` 
2. `$ cd /home/yourname/ros_ws/turtlebot_rl/scripts`, then `$ python crib_nav_qtable.py` to start Q learning.
> You can substitute `crib_nav_qtable.py` into `crib_nav_qnet.py` to start Q-net learning.

# Some notes on debugging original openai\_ros package
This repo was created to test the contents in this openai_ros's [tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/openai_ros/TurtleBot2%20with%20openai_ros).
However, may be different configurations were implemented, I made following changes to realize my turtlebot bumping around in the maze. <br/>
- In original tutorial, they must have a hokuyo lidar included in their simulation, 
but using their launch file would not bringup anything related to laser scan. 
So I have to copy the `fake laser` part in `turtlebot_gazebo`'s launch file.
Besides, the original tutorial was using the topic of `/kobuki/laser/scan` to publish laser's data,
hence I have to remap `scan` to `/kobuki/laser/scan` in my launch file.
- In original tutorial, they use topic of `cmd_vel` to publish command to control the turtlebot.
However, I found my turtlebot use topic of `/mobile_base/commands/velocity` to publish commands.
So, I have to edit ` ~/ros_ws/src/openai_ros/src/openai_ros/robot_envs/turtlebot2_env.py`.
> I don't understand why I cannot simply use a `remap` in my launch file to fix it.
Anyway, you'll find the topic around "line 76", just change the publisher's topic from `/cmd_vel` to `/mobile_base/commands/velocity`.
Then you should good to go.
